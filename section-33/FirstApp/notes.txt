EXPRESS
-first frameworks
-help build web apps
-npm package which comes with a bunch of methods and optional plugins that we can use to build web applications and API

-listen to incoming requests, url, query, form data, user/pass, etc.
-build data then send it back to user 

-helps with starting server to listen for requests
-parse incoming requests
-match those requests to particular routes
-craft our http response and associated content 


What are frameworks?
    Library: 
    -control flow of application code and decide when to use the Library

    Framework:
    -control is inverted --> framework is in charge
    -framework tells you where to plug in the code 

Express App
    -basic idea is that you can control what port number you are putting in
    -localhost:3000 or localhost:8080
    -depending on what you put for 'variable.listen' whatever is listening, it will go to that port number/server

    -.use utilizes the variable to send in a request to the server 
    -.listen calls for the server

Routing Basics
    Request and Response Objects
    -on every incoming requests, we have 2 different parameters in this function that are automatically passed in 
    -parameters are request, response (res, req) - made by Express
    
    -response object has methods on it, such as res.send(); - sends HTTP response through Express 
        -can be html, objects, strings, etc. 

    Routing
    -refers to taking incoming requests and a path that is requested and matching that to some code and some response
    -localhost:8080/dogs/cats/etc
    -res.send() can only send once per http request. so do it when you are done with sending the specific request. 

Path Parameters
-often want to define patterns for the route we take 
-use : to label as new path variable 
-accessing the place you need. you access through request object
-Express adds a property to the request object --> makes object for you and property is called params 

Query Strings 
-portion of url that comes after a ? 
-depending on how the application is set up.
    
    How it works
    -if we define some route, we do not add anything to the path here in terms of matching a query string
    -request object that Express constructs for user and passes into the callback,
        the request object h as a particular property called query and takes in key values pairs based on the query
    -use postman --> params --> key: q, value: whatever

Nodemon
-auto-restarting the server without clearing in the terminal and running it again
