Express Router Basics 
-router express - move and group routes together, put them in separate file = convience 

    Express Router and Middleware


Cookies
-cookies are bits of info that are stored in user's browser 
-once cookie is set, a user's browser will send the cookie on every subsequent request to the site
-cookies allow use to make HTTP stateful 

    Sending Cookies
    1. set up a route
    2. send a cookie to someone as a response and it'll be stored 

    Cookie Parser Middleware
    npm i cookie-parser
    ```const cookieParser = require('cookie-parser');
    app.use(cookieParser('thisismysecret'));```

    Signing Cookies
    -making sure the original data that is sent to client (browser) is still the data sent back to us 
    -ex: 
    app.get('/getsignedcookie', (req, res) => {
    res.cookie('fruit', 'grape', { signed: true })
    res.send('OK SIGNED YOUR FRUIT COOKIE!')

    -verifying the validity or that nothing has changed 
    app.get('/verifyfruit', (req, res) => {
    console.log(req.cookies)
    console.log(req.signedCookies)
    res.send(req.signedCookies)
    -maintains the integrity of the original signage. will be false or empty if signage is tampered with 

HMAC Signing:
hash-based message authentication code 
    -verifies integrity and authenticity of the cookie
    -takes cookie and signs it 
    -has to be same key and value otherwise, you will get different HMAC
