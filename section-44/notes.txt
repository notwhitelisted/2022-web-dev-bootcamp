Data Relationships with Mongo 

Intro to Mongo Relationships
-IRL: lots of different things stored in database 

SQL Relationships Overview
-SQL databases - relational DB that can be stored with info. 
-has strict schema 
-can model relationships by either referencing from one table in a second table or by creating new relationship tables

One to Few
-embed the data directly in the document

One to Many
-one option is to store your data separately, but then store references to document ID's somewhere inside the parent
-medium amt of data pproach
-don't directly embed the information in some parent document, but rather
    embed/store a reference to some document that is defined somewhere else 


One to Bajillions
-with thousands or more documents, it's more difficult to store a reference to the parent on the child document 
-lots of child documents/things associated with one things
-ex: tweets: can embed all tweets within 1 user into single user document
    -some people have thousands of tweets over a long period of time --> more efficient to store a reference to the parent on a child 
    -store a reference to the user on an individual tweets
-no need to make array, but you set it on the child

-.populate: builds a more complicated query BTS that is sent to mongo and fetch associated info to fill in instead of using the ID.
-main take away: embed or reference object ID, then use .populate method to get Mongoose to fetch appropriate information

Mongo Schema Design 
-integration with express app 
-look at MongoDB blog post for MongoDB Schema Design 
    -How am I going to use this data?
    -Where am I going to access it?
    -How will I access it?
    -What do I need frequently?
    -What do I need together? 
-could be reference from parent or referencing from a child or embedding data or setting 2 way references or duplicating data
