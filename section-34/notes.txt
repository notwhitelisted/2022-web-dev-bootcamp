Templating
-instead of writing static HTML code
-embed information and logic so we can repeat parts of the template (LOOP)
-can conditionally show or hide something whether you're logged in or not 

EJS - Embedded JS
-helps with configuring Express
-very similar to string template literal, but with HTML. 
-fill it in blanks or what you want to fill in 

-see views folder

-res.render() = view and sends the rendered HTML string to the client and then pass through file name 'home.ejs'

    Setting The Views Directory
    -default views directory that Express is looking for is only going to work if I am running my application from within
    same directory where my views folder is 
    -path module: comes built in with Node, gives us methods that have to do with file directory paths 

    EJS Syntax (Interpolation)
    -adding logic and fill in the blanks. 
        
        TAGS
        -EJS has particular tags that indicate to us 
        -NOT HTML, don't treat it like HTML
        -<%= 'whatever goes in here' %> will be javascript 

Passing Data to Templates
-see random.ejs 
-see /rand in index.js

Static Assets
-serve things such as CSS and JS files that we want to include in response to server side 

    express.static
    -middleware 
    -works by app.use(express.static('public')) - execute this every single request.

Creating Partials
-way of including other templates in other templates 
-bootstrap, jquery - duplicate before using it on other pages 
    --> create an all in one template. then include it in our sub templates whenever needed
