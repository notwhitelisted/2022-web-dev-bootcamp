    -easy to get started with (though it can be tricky to truly master)
    -plays particularly well with JS and strong community of developers with MongoDB

SQL vs. NoSQL Databases
    sql:
    -structured query language databases are relational databases. 
    -pre-define a schema of tables before inserting anything 
    -ex: MySQL, Postgres, SQLite, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server
    
    noSQL:
    -do not use SQL. many types of noSQL databases including document, key-value, and graph stores
    -ex: MongoDB, Couch DB, Neo4j, Cassandra, Redis

BSON
-binary JSON - more compact version of JSON (stored as binary)
