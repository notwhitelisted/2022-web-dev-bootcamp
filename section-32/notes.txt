1. Modules + NPM (node package manager)
-ex: npm - rainbow package (rainbow text, change terminal color output), figlet package (generates ascii art), 
franc package 

    2. Module.Exports
    -different ways to write it, but see math.js and app.js to learn more about it
    -exports variable is available within a module's file-level scope and is assigned the value of module.exports before 
        module is evaluated
    -if variable has new assignment, it will not run properly. so double check what the variable represents 

    3. Requiring Modules
    -set up the modules in their respective folders. start small
    -then go from small to bigger files to main files.
    
    4. Using NPM
    -library of tons of code and packages that is free to use 
    -command line tool to easily install and manage 

    5. Installing Packages
        a. npm install 'package name'
        b. you get node_modules - do not touch, package-lock.json - do not touch 
        c. npm i 'package name' or npm i -g === global installation

        dependencies: versions of objects necessary for express and node is going to install. 
            all in package.json file
            
    6. Creating Package.json files
    -instead of touching package.json myself and making it, run command 'npm init' 
    -creation utility for package.json
    -typically, just follow through with the package default template --> once completed --> get package.json file

    NOW, install a package, ex: figlet 'npm i figlet'
    -it will show in package.json folder
