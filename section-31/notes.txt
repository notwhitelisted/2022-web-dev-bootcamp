1. NODE.js
-javascript runtime, runs outside of the browser. 

    Usages:
    -web servers
    -command line tools
    -native apps (.exe, downloading the app to use instead of browser)
    -video games
    -drone software

-doesn't have access to window, document, DOM APIs 
-comes with built-in modules that don't exist in the browser. helps with operating system and files/folders 

-make .js file --> put javascript in the file --> run code with node filename.js
-have to be in the correct directory 

2. Process + ARGV
-an object that's available in global scope - without using require() or explicitly accessed using require()
-has info + control over the current node.js process. 

    process.argv: returns an array containing command line arguments passed when the Node.js process was launched
        -you can pass in arguments that will be created in the argv array. first is gonna be the executable path which is 
        the original
        -next the path that you will be actually running 


3. File System Module Crash Course 
    Boilerplate.js
    -in busy processes, use the asynchronous version of these calls
    -synchronous version will block the entire process until they complete, halting all connections
        -easy to follow
